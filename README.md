### **Interactive Principal component analysis non robust/robust**

|**Automatically show the plots of variance explained, correlations with PCA and outlier map to find and produce a GUI written with App designer to show in an interactive way different types of biplots.** <BR> Row and column points associated with arrows can be hidden or shown. The sign of the PCs can be interactively changed. The points can be shown with a color which is proportial to the othogonal distance to the space of the first 2 PCs. This enables us to immediately understannd which are the units that are not well represented in the subspace formed by the first two PCs | Call to function [pcaFS](http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/pcaFS.html) | [![View on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](xxx)   | [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=UniprJRC/FSDAexamples&file=examplesPCA.mlx)  |
|**Interactive brushing in the space of the first two PCs.** <BR> It is possible to brush a region in the biplot of the first two PCs and see the units shown in the original scatter plot matrix. Moreover if the units are are geographical coordinates and the latitude and longitude is given the geobubble plot is automatically shown. | Call to function [biplotFS](http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/biplotFS.html) | [![View on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](xxx) | [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=UniprJRC/FSDAexamples&file=examplesPCAinteractive.mlx) |
 **Robust principal component analysis.** <BR>   It is possible to use different robust methods to find a subset of clean units. For examples both the use of MCD with a level of trimming set by the user or the forward search fixing the proportion of units to use or to have an automatic outlier detection procedure. |  Call to function [pcaFS](http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/pcaFS.html) with option robust set to true. | [![View on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](xxx) |  [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=UniprJRC/FSDAexamples&file=examplesPCArobust.mlx) |

### **Interactive Correspondence analysis non robust/robust**

| **Correspondence analysis (traditional and robust).** <BR> It is possible to automatically the, singular values, the inertia, account for, and cumulative. For Row and Column Points we autoamtically show, for each dimension: the scores `Scores`, the Contribution of the points to the inertia of the dimension `CntrbPnt2In` and the Contribution of the dimension to the inertia of the point `CntrbDim2In`. Outlier detection using MCD or FS can be performed. Robust distances help to detect outlying rows in the contingency table.  | Call to functions [CorAna](http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/CorAna.html), [CorAnaplot](http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/CorAnaplot.html) and [moonplot](http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/moonplot.html), [mcdCorAna](http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/mcdCorAna.html) | [![View on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](xxx) | [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=UniprJRC/FSDAexamples&file=examplesCA.mlx) |
| **Interactive correspondence analysis.** <BR> It is possible to show, hide row and column points, to add supplementary row/column units, to add confidence ellipses to row/column points, to choose different graphical representations and to swith to the moonplot. It is also possible to recvert the sign of the principal axes and to perform robust analysis based on MCD or on the forward search. | Call to app CorAnaAPP | [![View on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](xxx) | [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=UniprJRC/FSDAexamples&file=examplesCAinteractive.mlx) |
